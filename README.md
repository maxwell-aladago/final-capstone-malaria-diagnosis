Together with my supervisors Dr. Elena Rosca and Dr. Lorenzo Torresani, demonstrated that semantic segmentation of the growth stages of malaria parasites can aid effective malaria diagnosis. The work won the second best paper award at the 2019 Meeting of the Minds synposium in Rwanda, accepted as a poster at the 2019 ACM COMPASS  in Accra and finally was eventually published at the IEEE here.
